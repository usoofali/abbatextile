## Laravel MCP

- MCP (Model Context Protocol) is very new. You must use the `search-docs` tool to get documentation for how to write and test Laravel MCP servers, tools, resources, and prompts effectively.
- MCP servers need to be registered with a route or handle in `routes/ai.php`. Typically, they will be registered using `Mcp::web()` to register a HTTP streaming MCP server.
- Servers are very testable - use the `search-docs` tool to find testing instructions.
- Do not run `mcp:start`. This command hangs waiting for JSON RPC MCP requests.
- Some MCP clients use Node, which has its own certificate store. If a user tries to connect to their web MCP server locally using https://, it could fail due to this reason. They will need to switch to http:// during local development.
