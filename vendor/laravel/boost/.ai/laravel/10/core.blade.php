## Laravel 10

- Use the `search-docs` tool to get version specific documentation.
- Middleware typically live in `app/Http/Middleware/` and service providers in `app/Providers/`.
- Laravel 10 has a `bootstrap/app.php` file that creates the application instance and binds kernel contracts, but does not use it for application configuration like Laravel 11:
    - Middleware registration is in `app/Http/Kernel.php`
    - Exception handling is in `app/Exceptions/Handler.php`
    - Console commands and schedule registration is in `app/Console/Kernel.php`
    - Rate limits likely exist in `RouteServiceProvider` or `app/Http/Kernel.php`
- When using Eloquent model casts, you must use `protected $casts = [];` and not the `casts()` method. The `casts()` method isn't available on models in Laravel 10.
