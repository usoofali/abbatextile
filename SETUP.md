-   Contact details setup
-   Logo and branding options

### üìä Sample Data

-   Pre-configured shops, categories, and products
-   Realistic test data for immediate use
-   Optional installation (can be skipped)

### üöÄ Production Optimization

-   Storage link creation for file uploads
-   Config caching
-   Route caching
-   View caching
-   Application key generation

## Usage

### Accessing Setup

1. **After Git Deployment**: Navigate to your domain (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com`)
2. **Automatic Redirect**: If no users exist, you'll be automatically redirected to `/setup`
3. **Manual Access**: You can also directly visit `/setup`

### Setup Process

#### Step 1: Application Settings

-   **Application Name**: The name of your POS system
-   **Application URL**: Your domain URL (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com`)

#### Step 2: Database Configuration

-   **Database Host**: Usually `localhost` for shared hosting
-   **Database Port**: Usually `3306` for MySQL
-   **Database Name**: Your database name
-   **Database Username**: Your database username
-   **Database Password**: Your database password

#### Step 3: Administrator Account

-   **Admin Name**: Full name of the administrator
-   **Admin Email**: Email address for login
-   **Admin Password**: Secure password (minimum 8 characters)

#### Step 4: Company Information

-   **Company Name**: Your business name
-   **Company Email**: Business email address
-   **Company Phone**: Contact phone number
-   **Company Address**: Business address

#### Step 5: Sample Data (Optional)

-   Pre-configured shops, categories, and products
-   Can be skipped if you prefer to start with a clean system

### Security Features

#### Access Control

-   Setup is only accessible when no users exist
-   Automatically redirects to login after completion
-   Middleware protection against unauthorized access

#### Data Validation

-   Comprehensive form validation
-   Email format validation
-   Password strength requirements
-   Database connection testing

## Technical Implementation

### Components

#### Setup Configuration Component

-   **Location**: `resources/views/livewire/setup/configuration.blade.php`
-   **Purpose**: Main setup interface and logic
-   **Features**: Progress tracking, error handling, logging

#### Middleware

-   **Location**: `app/Http/Middleware/EnsureSetupNotCompleted.php`
-   **Purpose**: Protects setup from unauthorized access
-   **Logic**: Redirects to login if users exist

#### Routes

-   **Setup Route**: `/setup` - Main setup interface
-   **Home Route**: `/` - Redirects based on setup status
-   **Protection**: Middleware ensures proper access control

### Database Operations

#### Migrations

-   Runs all pending migrations
-   Creates necessary database tables
-   Handles schema updates

#### Sample Data Creation

-   **Shops**: Creates a main branch location
-   **Categories**: Sets up fabric categories (Cotton, Silk, Linen, Denim)
-   **Products**: Creates sample textile products with realistic pricing

### Environment Management

#### Configuration Updates

-   Updates `.env` file with provided settings
-   Handles database connection parameters
-   Sets application name and URL

#### Optimization

-   Creates storage symbolic link for file uploads
-   Clears and caches configuration
-   Optimizes routes and views
-   Generates application key if missing

## Testing

### Test Coverage

-   **Setup Component Tests**: `tests/Feature/SetupTest.php`
-   **Middleware Tests**: `tests/Feature/SetupMiddlewareTest.php`

### Test Scenarios

-   Setup accessibility with/without existing users
-   Form validation and error handling
-   Database operations and data creation
-   Security and access control
-   Progress tracking and logging

## Deployment Workflow

### HPanel Deployment Process

1. **Git Push**: Deploy code to hosting environment
2. **Database Setup**: Create MySQL database in HPanel
3. **Access Setup**: Visit your domain to access setup interface
4. **Configuration**: Fill out the setup form with your settings
5. **Completion**: System redirects to login after successful setup

### Environment Requirements

#### Server Requirements

-   MySQL 5.7 or higher
-   Composer
-   Git

#### Laravel Requirements

-   All Laravel 11 requirements
-   Livewire 3
-   Volt components

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Database Connection Failed

-   Ensure database user has proper permissions

#### Setup Not Accessible

-   Clear browser cache
-   Check if users already exist in database
-   Verify middleware configuration

#### Migration Errors

-   Check database permissions
-   Verify Laravel configuration
-   Review error logs for specific issues

### Error Handling

#### Progress Logging

-   Real-time progress updates
-   Detailed error messages
-   Step-by-step completion tracking

#### Recovery Options

-   Retry failed operations
-   Skip optional components
-   Manual database intervention if needed

## Security Considerations

### Access Protection
